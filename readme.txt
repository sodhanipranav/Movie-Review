   What does it do?
   ----------------

   This website is a simplified version of a movie database search and update engine like IMdb. It supports features like search
   and insertion of new entries into the database. The search result summarizes the data in a description like fashion such as ..
   "Born on yyyy-mm-dd, Tom has starred in x movies. He/She is xx years old." (All asked features have been implemented).
